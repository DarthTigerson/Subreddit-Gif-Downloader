# Subreddit Gif Downloader 

I created this script to be able to download hundreds of images an gifs at once from subreddits.

# Requirements

    pip3 install requests

Open up subreddit_list.csv and enter the URL of the subreddit you want.

The default download limit is 100 but by modifiy downloadLimite from main.py you can change to whatever you wish.
